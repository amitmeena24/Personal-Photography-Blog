                        What Is Photography?
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        Photography is the art of capturing light with a camera, usually via a digital sensor or film,
                        to create an image. With the right camera equipment, you can even photograph wavelengths of
                        light invisible to the human eye, including UV, infrared, and radio.

                    <p>The first permanent photograph was captured in 1826 (some sources say 1827) by Joseph Nicéphore
                        <b>Niépce in France</b>. It shows the roof of a building lit by the sun.</p>
                    </p>
                    <h1>
                        What Camera Do You Need for Photography?
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        Many people today believe that their phone is good enough for most photography, and they have no
                        need to buy a separate camera. And you know what? They’re not wrong. For most people out there,
                        a dedicated camera is overkill.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Phones are better than dedicated cameras for most people’s needs. They’re quicker and easier to
                        use, not to mention their seamless integration with social media. It only makes sense to get a
                        dedicated camera if your phone isn’t good enough for the photos you want (like photographing
                        sports or low-light environments) or if you’re specifically interested in photography as a
                        hobby.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That advice may sound crazy coming from a photographer, but it’s true. If you have any camera at
                        all, especially a cell phone camera, you have what you need in order to take great photos. And
                        if you have a more advanced camera, like a DSLR or mirrorless camera, what more is there to say?
                        This is the guide for you – it’s time to learn photography.
                    </p>
                    <h1>The First Steps on Your Photographic Journey</h1>
                    <p>
                        In photography, the technical and the creative go hand in hand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Remember the Ansel Adams quote from earlier? There is nothing worse than a sharp image of a
                        fuzzy concept. If the idea behind a photo is weak, using the right camera settings won’t make it
                        better.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the same time, camera settings are some of the most important tools you have at your
                        disposal. In a way, every technical choice is really an artistic choice in disguise. These
                        settings are worth learning. Your understanding of photography will improve tenfold when you
                        understand how camera settings work.
                    </p>
                    <h1>The Three Fundamental Camera Settings You Should Know</h1>
                    <p>
                        Your camera has dozens of buttons and menu options. If you pick the wrong camera settings, it’s
                        possible that your photo won’t turn out the way you want. How do you make sense of all these
                        options? And how do you do it quickly in the field?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s not easy, but it’s easier than you might think. In fact, most of the menu options are
                        things you’ll only set one time, then rarely or never touch again. Only a handful of settings
                        need to be changed frequently, and that’s what the rest of this Photography Basics guide covers
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The three most important settings are called shutter speed, aperture, and ISO. All three of them
                        control the brightness of your photo, although they do so in different ways. In other words,
                        each brings its own “side effects” to an image.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Shutter speed:</h3>
                    <p>Shutter speed is the length of time camera shutter is open, exposing light onto the camera
                        sensor. Essentially, it’s how long your camera spends taking a photo. This has a few important
                        effects in how your images will appear.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Aperture:</h3>
                    <p>Aperture can be defined as the opening in a lens through which light passes to enter the camera.
                        It is an easy concept to understand if you just think about how your eyes work. As you move
                        between bright and dark environments, the iris in your eyes either expands or shrinks,
                        controlling the size of your pupil.In photography, the “pupil” of your lens is called
                        aperture. You can shrink or enlarge the size of the aperture to allow more or less light to
                        reach your camera sensor.
                    <p>
                        Aperture can add dimension to your photos by controlling depth of field. At one extreme,
                        aperture gives you a blurred background with a beautiful shallow focus effect.

                        At the other, it will give you sharp photos from the nearby foreground to the distant horizon.
                        On top of that, it also alters the exposure of your images by making them brighter or darker.
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <h3>ISO:</h3>
                    <p>In very basic terms, ISO is simply a camera setting that will brighten or darken a photo. As you
                        increase your ISO number, your photos will grow progressively brighter. For that reason, ISO can
                        help you capture images in darker environments, or be more flexible about your aperture and
                        shutter speed settings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, raising your ISO has consequences. A photo taken at too high of an ISO will show a lot
                        of grain, also known as noise, and might not be usable. So, brightening a photo via ISO is
                        always a trade-off. You should only raise your ISO when you are unable to brighten the photo via
                        shutter speed or aperture instead (for example, if using a longer shutter speed would cause your
                        subject to be blurry).
                    </p>

            <h1>Photography FAQ</h1>
            <p>If you have any additional questions, or you are looking for a quick answer to your question, we put
                together a small FAQ section related to photography below:</p>
            <h2>What is the purpose of photography?</h2>
            <p>The purpose of photography can vary depending on what the photographer is trying to achieve. For example,
                documentary and news photographers capture images for the purpose of providing detailed account of
                actual events, while hobbyist photographers aim to capture life moments with their families and friends.

            </p>
            <h2>What do you need for photography?</h2>
            <p>To start taking pictures, all you need is a camera, which can be anything from a basic smartphone to an
                advanced DSLR or a mirrorless camera. However, photography equipment is not all that important – light,
                subject, emotion and composition are all critical elements of a successful photograph.
            </p>
            <h2>What is the most common type of photography?</h2>
            <p>There are a number of photography genres that are very popular today. These include portrait, landscape,

                rest of photography equipment is going to be based on your needs. For example, if you want to do
                landscape photography, you will need a number of different lenses, a tripod and filters. For portrait
                photography, you will need to invest in a good portrait lens and potentially some lighting equipment.
            </p>
            <h2>What is the oldest photograph?</h2>
            <p>A photography “genre” is a type of photography, such as landscape photography, portrait photography,
                wildlife photography, etc.
            </p>
            <h2>How can I learn photography?</h2>
